# LFAC_compiler
As the final task for Formal Languages, Automata and Compilers, I developed this compiler using LEX and YACC.
As a sidenote, this task was done in Second year, First semester at FII UAIC, 2016-2017 and it was my first bit homework.

I enjoyed working at this and I know that my solution might not be the best, but I consider it abstract and funny anyway.

The files have the following meanning:
linbaj.l - LEX file, here using regex I identified variables and keywords.
limbaj.y - YACC file, here I defined the language and some predifined functions.
lfac_header.h - Header file, here I defined what is a variable, a function and the logic.
